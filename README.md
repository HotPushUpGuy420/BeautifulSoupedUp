BeautfiulSoupedUp is a little GUI utility for helping construct BeautifulSoup
queries.  It's a little old and rickety, but you might find it useful (or
inspiring to develop something better).  Basically you get a GUI like this:

You can cut and paste your own HTML into the center-panel and type your own
query in up the top.  Then hit the "Run query" button to highlight any matches.
If I can still recall correctly after about 5 years, I believe there may be some
edge cases that won't work.  Sorry.  If someone decides to write an equivalent
tool as a web browser plugin, perhaps one that runs the query after each
character is typed, that would be a big improvement.

# Dependencies

I'm pretty sure BeautifulSoupedUp wont' work with the 4.x line of BeautifulSoup,
i.e. you'll need to install something from the old 3.x line.
